Family Genealogy Platform PRD Template
Based on your tech stack, here's a customized template structure:

1. Executive Summary
   Product Vision: Private digital family tree and genealogy management platform that enables families to collaboratively preserve and share their heritage with complete data ownership and privacy.

Target Market: Families who want to maintain private family trees without sharing data with commercial genealogy companies, with a focus on collaborative editing and media-rich storytelling.

Core Value Proposition: Unlike public genealogy platforms (Ancestry, MyHeritage) that share your family data with partners and charge $2,880+/year for 20 users, our platform provides private, family-only access with collaborative editing for ~$25-50/month total hosting costs.

2. Product Objectives
   Primary: Enable families to build comprehensive digital family trees with collaborative editing and media storage
   Secondary: Facilitate photo/document sharing, story preservation, and family history documentation
   Tertiary: Provide privacy-first genealogy management with complete family data ownership

Success Metrics:

- User Acquisition: 50+ families sign up in first month
- Feature Usage: 70% of users upload at least one photo within first week
- Collaboration: 60% of families have 3+ active contributors
- Retention: 40% weekly active users after first month
- Engagement: Average of 5+ family members added per month per family

### 1. Summary

Families need a private, collaborative platform to maintain their genealogy without sharing sensitive family data with commercial companies. Current solutions like Ancestry and MyHeritage are expensive ($2,880+/year for 20 users), lack real-time collaboration, and compromise privacy.

### 10. Risks and Mitigations

**Technical Risks:**

- Real-time collaboration complexity → Use proven Supabase real-time features with fallback polling
- File upload reliability → Implement chunked uploads with retry logic
- Mobile performance → Optimize with Next.js Image and lazy loading

**User Experience Risks:**

- Complex family relationships → Start with basic parent/child/spouse, add complexity iteratively
- Elderly user adoption → Simple, familiar interface with guided onboarding
- Data entry fatigue → Smart defaults, bulk operations, and import capabilities

**Business Risks:**

- Family data privacy concerns → Clear privacy policy, GDPR compliance, transparent data handling
- User acquisition challenges → Focus on family historians as initial advocates
- Feature scope creep → Strict MVP definition with post-launch roadmap

### 11. Open Questions

**Technical Decisions:**

- Tree visualization approach: family-chart vs custom D3 implementation?
- Media storage limits: Implement file size limits and compression strategies?
- Audit trail depth: How far back to maintain change history?

**User Experience:**

- Family invitation flow: Email-based vs link-sharing approach?
- Mobile optimization: Progressive Web App features for offline access?
- Search functionality: Simple text search vs advanced genealogy search?

**Business Model:**

- Pricing strategy: Freemium vs flat family pricing vs usage-based?
- Data portability: GEDCOM export standards and compatibility?
- Family size limits: How to handle very large extended families?
