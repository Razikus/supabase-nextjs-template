# PRD vs MVP vs ADR Documentation: Complete Breakdown

### **1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Purpose**: Defines **what** the product will do and **how** users will interact with it[1]

**Focus**: User-facing functionality and requirements[2]

- **Functional requirements** - What the product must do
- **User experience specifications** - How users interact with features
- **Success criteria** - Measurable goals and performance benchmarks
- **Non-functional requirements** - Security, performance, compliance needs

**When to Use**:

- **Before development begins** - Planning and alignment phase[3]
- **Waterfall environments** - Sequential development approach[1]
- **Complex products** - When detailed specifications are needed upfront

**Audience**: Product managers, engineering teams, design teams, QA teams[2]

**Key Characteristics**:

- **User-centric** - Written from end-user perspective[4]
- **Feature-focused** - Details specific capabilities and functionality
- **External-facing** - Describes what users will see and experience

### **2. MVP Documentation**

**Purpose**: Defines the **minimum viable features** needed to test market viability

**Focus**: Learning and validation through real user feedback[5]

- **Core features only** - Essential functionality for initial launch
- **Hypothesis-driven** - Features designed to test specific assumptions
- **Iterative approach** - Built to evolve based on user feedback
- **Learning objectives** - What you want to discover from users

**When to Use**:

- **New product launches** - When market fit is uncertain
- **Startup environments** - Resource-constrained rapid iteration
- **Hypothesis testing** - When you need to validate assumptions quickly

**Audience**: Product team, early adopters, investors, stakeholders[5]

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Learning-oriented** - Designed to gather user insights
- **Minimal scope** - Only essential features included
- **Evolution-ready** - Built to change based on feedback

### **3. Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**

**Purpose**: Documents **why** technical decisions were made and their consequences[6]

**Focus**: Technical architecture and engineering decisions[7]

- **Technical choices** - Frameworks, databases, cloud services, patterns
- **Decision rationale** - Why this option was chosen over alternatives
- **Trade-offs analysis** - Pros, cons, and implications of the decision
- **Future context** - Information for future team members

**When to Use**:

- **Significant technical decisions** - Architecture that affects the whole system[8]
- **Multiple viable options** - When there are several technical approaches[8]
- **Long-term projects** - Decisions that will impact future development[9]
- **Team transitions** - Documenting context for new team members[8]

**Audience**: Engineering teams, architects, future developers, technical stakeholders[9]

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Decision-focused** - Documents the "why" behind technical choices[7]
- **Immutable** - Once accepted, becomes permanent record[7]
- **Context-rich** - Includes alternatives considered and trade-offs made
- **Append-only** - New decisions supersede old ones rather than editing[9]

## **When to Use Each Document Type**

### **Project Timeline Integration**:

**1. PRD â†’ MVP â†’ ADR** (Traditional Flow)

```
PRD (Planning) â†’ MVP Subset â†’ ADR (Technical Implementation)
```

**2. MVP-First â†’ PRD â†’ ADR** (Lean Startup Flow)

```
MVP (Learning) â†’ Updated PRD â†’ ADR (Scale Architecture)
```

**3. Concurrent Approach** (Most Recommended)

```
Mini-PRD + MVP Plan + Critical ADRs (Parallel Development)
```

### **Specific Use Cases**:

| **Use PRD When:**            | **Use MVP Docs When:**        | **Use ADR When:**                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Clear requirements exist     | Market fit uncertain          | Technical choice needed           |
| Waterfall development        | Startup/early stage           | Multiple tech options             |
| Complex feature sets         | Resource constraints          | Significant architecture decision |
| Regulatory compliance needed | Fast feedback loops required  | Team scaling/transitions          |
| Large development teams      | Hypothesis-driven development | Long-term maintenance concerns    |

## **ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Approach for Your Project**

### **Week 1-2: Foundation Documents**

- **Lean PRD** (3-5 pages) - Core user stories and success metrics
- **MVP Scope** (1-2 pages) - Minimal feature set for learning
- **Critical ADRs** (1 page each) - Major technical decisions only

### **Week 3-8: Development & Learning**

- Build MVP based on PRD subset
- Create ADRs for technical decisions as they arise
- Collect user feedback and metrics

### **Week 9+: Scale & Iterate**

- **Update PRD** based on MVP learnings
- **New ADRs** for scaling architecture decisions
- **Next MVP iteration** planning

## **Key Insights**:

1. **They're complementary** - Each serves different stakeholders and purposes[2]
2. **ADRs are technical** - Focus on engineering decisions, not user features[10]
3. **MVP evolves into PRD** - Learning from MVP informs fuller product requirements
4. **ADRs are permanent** - Create historical record of technical reasoning[7]

The most successful projects use all three strategically rather than choosing just one approach.[9][8]
