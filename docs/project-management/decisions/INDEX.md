## 🎯 Purpose & Benefits

> An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.

Our ADRs serve to:

- 🚀 **Accelerate Development** - Clear technical decisions guide rapid MVP development
- 🔭 **Preserve Decision Context** - Historical context for future maintainers and contributors
- 🤝 **Document Rationale** - Transparent reasoning for technical and product choices
- 📈 **Enable Scaling** - Foundation for future feature additions and architectural evolution

## 🔄 ADR Lifecycle

ADRs follow this collaborative workflow:

1. **Draft** → Initial proposal and context gathering
2. **Proposed** → Open for review and discussion
3. **Accepted** → Decision implemented and documented
4. **Deprecated/Superseded** → When better alternatives emerge
