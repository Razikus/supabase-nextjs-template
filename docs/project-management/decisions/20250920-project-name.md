## Context and Problem Statement

We need a project name and domain that communicates family collaboration and genealogy, feels warm and private, and is easy for family members to say and spell.

## Decision Drivers

- Clarity and family-friendly tone
- Memorability and pronounceability
- Domain availability under .family
- Alignment with tree and lineage metaphors

## Considered Options

- HallowBranch — [hallowbranch.family](http://hallowbranch.family)
- HallowKin — [hallowkin.family](http://hallowkin.family)
- HallowTree — [hallowtree.family](http://hallowtree.family)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "HallowBranch", because it clearly evokes family lineage, reads warmly, and the .family domain is available at a reasonable cost.

### Positive Consequences

- Clear metaphor that ties to the family tree
- Distinctive yet easy to pronounce
- Domain available today

### Negative Consequences

- Slightly longer than HallowKin
- Potential confusion with branch vs entire tree metaphor

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### HallowBranch

- Good, because evokes a specific family branch metaphor
- Good, because available .family domain
- Bad, because slightly longer and less generic than "Tree"

### HallowKin

- Good, because short and punchy
- Good, because emphasizes people over structure
- Bad, because "kin" can feel old-fashioned to some

### HallowTree

- Good, because instantly communicates tree visualization
- Good, because familiar term
- Bad, because broader and less distinctive than HallowBranch
