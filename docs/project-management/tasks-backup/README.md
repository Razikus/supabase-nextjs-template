# Task Management System - HallowBranch Genealogy Platform

## Overview

This task management system tracks the development of HallowBranch, a private family genealogy platform built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. It provides structured tracking for work items, dependencies, and progress across development phases.

## Purpose

The task system addresses several critical needs for the HallowBranch genealogy platform:

- **Visibility**: Clear understanding of development progress and current priorities
- **Dependencies**: Explicit tracking of task relationships and blockers
- **Prioritization**: P0/P1/P2 classification for feature development and bug fixes
- **Validation**: Success criteria and validation steps for genealogy features
- **Documentation**: Detailed implementation guidance for complex genealogy workflows
- **Privacy Focus**: Ensuring all development maintains the platform's privacy-first approach

## How to Use This System

### 1. Check Current Status

Review `INDEX.md` for:

- Overall project progress percentage
- Current phase and priorities
- Task dependencies and blockers
- Critical path for completion

### 2. Select a Task

Choose tasks marked as üîÑ Ready that match your expertise:

- **DEV** tasks: Development setup, tooling, dependencies
- **FEAT** tasks: New genealogy features and functionality
- **BUG** tasks: Bug fixes and issue resolution
- **DOCS** tasks: Documentation and guides
- **TEST** tasks: Testing implementation and coverage
- **PERF** tasks: Performance optimizations
- **SEC** tasks: Security improvements (privacy-focused)
- **REFACTOR** tasks: Code refactoring and improvements

### 3. Follow Task Structure

Each task file contains:

- Clear objective and success criteria
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Validation commands specific to Next.js/React/Supabase stack
- Dependencies and prerequisites

### 2. Assign Task ID

Use sequential numbering with HallowBranch prefixes:

- DEV-001, DEV-002, etc.
- FEAT-001, FEAT-002, etc.
- BUG-001, BUG-002, etc.

### 3. Use the Template

Copy `template.md` and fill in all sections:

- Keep descriptions concise and actionable
- Include specific commands for Next.js/React/Supabase stack
- Define clear success criteria for genealogy features
- **IMPORTANT**: Run `date +"%Y-%m-%d"` to get current date for Created/Updated fields
- Update the "Updated" field whenever status changes
- Customize validation commands for npm/yarn, Supabase, and testing tools

### 4. Update INDEX.md

Add your task to the appropriate phase table and update:

- Task counts and time estimates
- Dependency graph if needed
- Overall completion percentage
- HallowBranch-specific phases and timelines

## Best Practices

### Task Sizing

- **Small** (1-2 hours): Single file changes, simple configurations
- **Medium** (3-4 hours): Multi-file changes, new features
- **Large** (5+ hours): Consider breaking into subtasks

### Dependencies

- List explicit task IDs that must complete first
- Use "None" for tasks that can start immediately
- Update blocked tasks when dependencies complete

### Validation

- Include specific commands to verify success for your tech stack
- Reference test files or build scripts
- Document expected output
- Customize validation for your specific tools (npm, yarn, docker, terraform, etc.)

### Documentation

- Link to relevant project documentation
- Reference external resources specific to your tech stack
- Include troubleshooting tips for your tools

## Example Implementation

See [`tasks/`](tasks/) for a complete working example of the task management system in action. This includes:

- **6 example tasks** across 3 categories (DEV, FEAT, TEST)
- **Real implementation steps** with actual commands
- **Dependency management** showing how tasks block each other
- **Complete workflow** from setup to testing

### Quick Start with Example

```bash
# 1. Explore the example tasks
cat tasks/INDEX.md | head -20
cat tasks/development/DEV-001-*.md

# 2. See the dependency graph
cat tasks/INDEX.md | grep -A 10 "Task Dependencies"

# 3. Try validation commands from the tasks
cd tasks
npm run build    # Example command from DEV-003
npm test         # Example command from TEST-001
```

The example demonstrates a complete project workflow from development setup through feature implementation to testing.
