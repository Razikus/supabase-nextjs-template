## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2025-09-22 - Dark Mode Fixes

### Fixed

#### Dark Mode Visual Issues ðŸŽ¨
- **File Storage Page**
  - Fixed white background in file upload area by using `bg-secondary` (provides better contrast than `bg-card`)
  - Fixed file list items showing white backgrounds in dark mode
  - Replaced hardcoded colors (`bg-white`, `text-gray-*`) with semantic tokens
  - Migrated file action buttons to shadcn/ui Button components for consistent theming
  - Removed hardcoded button colors (blue/green/red) in favor of semantic variants
  - Added proper hover states that work in both light and dark modes

- **Cookie Consent Banner**
  - Fixed cookie banner staying white in dark mode by using `bg-background`
  - Updated all text colors to use semantic tokens (`text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`)
  - Replaced hardcoded link colors with `text-primary hover:text-primary/80`
  - Removed custom button color overrides to allow proper theme inheritance

### Changed

- **Component Improvements**
  - Added Button and Input component imports to storage page
  - Replaced native HTML buttons with shadcn/ui Button components (variant="ghost" size="icon")
  - Used `bg-secondary` instead of `bg-card` for better visual hierarchy and contrast
  - Removed all hardcoded color classes in favor of semantic design tokens
  - Improved contrast ratios for better accessibility in both themes

### Technical Details

- **Files Modified**
  - `/nextjs/src/app/app/storage/page.tsx` - Complete dark mode fixes for file management
  - `/nextjs/src/components/Cookies.tsx` - Full theme support for cookie banner

### Notes

- The issue with `bg-card` was that it used the same color as `bg-background` in both themes
- Using `bg-secondary` provides better visual hierarchy with proper contrast
- All components now properly adapt to theme changes without hardcoded colors
