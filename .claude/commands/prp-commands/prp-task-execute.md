   - Perform ACTION following Next.js/Supabase patterns
   - Run VALIDATE using repository commands
   - Fix IF_FAIL issues with repository-specific debugging

3. **Complete Checklist**

   - Run final validation (TypeScript, ESLint, build)
   - Check no regressions in the Next.js/Supabase codebase

Work through tasks sequentially, validating each.
