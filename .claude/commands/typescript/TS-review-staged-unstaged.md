## Review Focus Areas

1. **TypeScript Code Quality**

   - Strict TypeScript usage with explicit types
   - No `any` types - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
   - Proper type imports with `import type { }` syntax
   - Component props interfaces defined
   - Supabase generated types used properly
   - Following TypeScript strict mode compliance

2. **Next.js-Specific Patterns**

   - Proper Server vs Client Component usage ('use client' directives)
   - App Router conventions and file structure
   - React component patterns with shadcn/ui integration
   - Proper use of React props and TypeScript interfaces
   - SassClient wrapper pattern for Supabase operations
   - Environment variable typing with proper Next.js patterns

3. **Performance & Bundle Optimization**

   - No unnecessary 'use client' directives
   - Appropriate Server vs Client Component choices
   - Image optimization with Next.js Image component
   - Bundle size considerations
   - Build optimization and static generation

4. **Security & Validation**

   - Input validation with proper TypeScript types
   - Environment variables properly typed
   - Supabase Row Level Security implementation
   - No hardcoded secrets in client-side code
   - API route validation with proper error handling

5. **Supabase Integration**

   - SassClient wrapper pattern usage
   - Proper Supabase type integration
   - Authentication flow implementation
   - Database query optimization
   - Real-time subscription patterns

6. **Package Management**

   - Using yarn (repository standard)
   - Proper dependency management
   - No unused dependencies
   - Correct dev vs runtime dependencies

7. **Code Structure & Architecture**

   - Components follow reasonable size limits
   - Functions under 50 lines with single responsibility
   - Proper separation of concerns
   - Feature-based organization in App Router
   - Next.js best practices followed

8. **Repository Standards**

   - ESLint compliance with zero warnings
   - TypeScript strict mode compliance
   - Repository-specific patterns adherence
   - Component naming conventions
   - Import path consistency

9. **Build & Development**

   - `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
   - ESLint compliance with zero warnings
   - Prettier formatting applied
   - Production build succeeds
   - No hydration mismatches

10. **Documentation & Maintenance**
    - Clear component interfaces
    - Proper prop descriptions
    - CLAUDE.md updates for new patterns/dependencies
    - README updates if needed
